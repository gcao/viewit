<h1>Instrument Anything in Rails 3</h1>
<p>
  With Rails 3.0 released a few weeks ago I've migrated a few apps and
  I'm constantly finding useful new improvements.  One such improvement is
  the ability to log anything in the same way that Rails internally logs
  ActiveRecord and ActionView.  By default Rails 3 logs look slightly
  spiffier than those produced by Rails 2.3: (notice the second line has
  been cleaned up)
</p>
<pre><code>Started GET "/" for 127.0.0.1 at Mon Sep 06 01:07:11 -0400 2010&#x000A;  Processing by HomeController#index as HTML&#x000A;  User Load (0.2ms)  SELECT `users`.* FROM `users` WHERE (`users`.`id` = 3) LIMIT 1&#x000A;  CACHE (0.0ms)  SELECT `users`.* FROM `users` WHERE (`users`.`id` = 3) LIMIT 1&#x000A;Rendered layouts/_nav.html.erb (363.4ms)&#x000A;Rendered layouts/_nav.html.erb (1.1ms)&#x000A;Rendered layouts/_footer.html.erb (2.6ms)&#x000A;Rendered home/index.html.erb within layouts/application (503.6ms)&#x000A;Completed 200 OK in 510ms (Views: 507.9ms | ActiveRecord: 406.3ms)</code></pre>
<p>
  This output format is very informative, but what if we're using
  MongoDB or CouchDB instead of ActiveRecord? What if our page has a Solr
  query that takes up a signification portion of the response time, and we
  want to break it out of the total?
</p>
<p>
  The app I'm working on at Market.io uses Solr extensively via the
  <a href='http://delsolr.rubyforge.org/'>delsolr</a>
  gem.  Since delsolr is not Rails-specific, I have created a wrapper
  around the service calls to add hooks.  If I wanted to log Solr queries I
  could just add
  <code>Rails.logger.info "Solr query: #{query}"</code>
  but now Rails provides a better way.

<p>
  In Rails 3, logging has been abstracted into
  <a href='http://rdoc.info/github/rails/rails/v3.0.0/ActiveSupport/Notifications'>ActiveSupport::Notifications</a>,
  which publishes logging events, and
  <a href='http://rdoc.info/github/rails/rails/v3.0.0/ActiveSupport/LogSubscriber'>ActiveSupport::LogSubscriber</a>,
  which consumes the events and logs the output.  This abstraction lets
  any number of entities publish notifications. (I'm calling those
  entities "services" for the purpose of this article, but any call can be
  instrumented.)
</p>
<p>
  ActiveRecord provides an excellent example of how to subscribe to
  notifications.  I've adapted it to delsolr with minimal changes.  First
  we tell Rails what to instrument:
